The result showed that the combination comprised of (10 mg/l (I) and 0.062 mg/l (S)-N-[[2-fluoro-4 -[2-hydroxy-3-(3,4,5-trichlorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidin-1- yl]phenyl]methyl]cyclopropanecarboxamide exhibited 100% of mortality.","Status as of : 08.12.2022

The step of plant fixation involves fixing plants by pebbles, filling a layer with pebbles at the bottom of the planting basket before fixing to prevent original roots from directly penetrating out of bottom of planting basket, placing plants which are trimmed and sterilized into planting basket, and adding the pebbles continuously to fix the plants in the planting basket. The hydroponics domestication involves fixing the planting basket fixedly provided with the plants into container, adding clear water or culture solution into planting basket, dripping the liquid into container after the liquid flows through pebbles, and stopping adding the liquid until the liquid in container is level to bottom of planting basket. The maintenance management involves observing growth of the plants at the right time and changing liquid in the container every week. 
   USE - Method for performing hydroponics planting method of Cycas debaoensis seedlings is used for plant cultivation, ornamental, teaching and scientific research.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables to break through the traditional concepts that Cycas plants are drought-resistant, water logging-resistant and the root systems are not water-resistant to soaking, successfully applies the water culture technology to the cultivation of Cycas debaoensis seedlings and ensures the survival rate of the Cycas debaoensis seedlings. The root system of the hydroponic Cycas debaoensis seedling is extended into water, the growth and form of the root system is clearly and visually observed, hydroponic Cycas debaoensis seedling is a good science popularization teaching material, and complete root system is easy to obtain, is used for scientific research, lays a foundation for protecting biological diversity, and has good ecological benefit and social benefit.","Status as of : 08.12.2022
