The root processing treatment involves lifting the Cycas debaoensis seedlings from culture medium, cleaning residual matrix or soil at the roots with flowing clear water, cutting out rotten roots, diseased and weak roots and broken roots, flattening the cut openings, and soaking the roots with a bactericide to obtain sterilized plants for later use. 
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Performing hydroponics planting method of Cycas debaoensis seedlings involves performing root processing treatment, plant fixation, hydroponics domestication and maintenance management, where pebbles are fixed in planting basket and placed in a container after the Cycas debaoensis seedlings are trimmed and the root system of bactericides are soaked, clear water or culture solution is added, the growth condition of the plants is observed in time, and the liquid in the container is replaced every week. The root processing treatment involves lifting the Cycas debaoensis seedlings from culture medium, cleaning residual matrix or soil at the roots with flowing clear water, cutting out rotten roots, diseased and weak roots and broken roots, flattening the cut openings, and soaking the roots with a bactericide to obtain sterilized plants for later use. The step of plant fixation involves fixing plants by pebbles, filling a layer with pebbles at the bottom of the planting basket before fixing to prevent original roots from directly penetrating out of bottom of planting basket, placing plants which are trimmed and sterilized into planting basket, and adding the pebbles continuously to fix the plants in the planting basket. The hydroponics domestication involves fixing the planting basket fixedly provided with the plants into container, adding clear water or culture solution into planting basket, dripping the liquid into container after the liquid flows through pebbles, and stopping adding the liquid until the liquid in container is level to bottom of planting basket.
